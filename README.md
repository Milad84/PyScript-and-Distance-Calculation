# PyScript-and-Distance-Calculation
This is a repository to explore different ways of distance calculation in a web development setting and by using Python and PyScript as an alternative to JavaScript! However, when things get complicated we switch to the combination of Python and JavaScript as a solution! We plan to replicate techniques in CherryPy too.
